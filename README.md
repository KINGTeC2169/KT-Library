KT-Library:
This repository is the storing ground of any analogous code for KINGTeC.
Any code that is likely to be reused in the future is included within this repository.

To make a sample, if the catagory for that sample already exists, create a directory under that directory, if not, make a new directory for the catagory.  Name the directory according to what the system you are creating is, for example, a 3CIM Tank DriveTrain might have the name "3CIM Tank Drive".  Inside this, you need to add 4 things.  A readme with the details of what the code contains, a class.java file for the subsystem itself, a controls.txt file containing information taht needs to be added to the controls.java class of KT-Iterative, and a constants txt file that works the same way.  If needed, a superstructure.txt file can be added it that is useful.

See the sample for details.

This is open-sourced for a reason, and other teams are free to use (and even fork and contribute) to this library.
